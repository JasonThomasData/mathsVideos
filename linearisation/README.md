This is my entry into the Swinburne University 2022 Mathstory competition.

All software used here are free or open source.

There is a Jupyter Notebook, which uses the Octave Kernel, [here](notes.ipynb)

The slides were made using LibreOffice Impress and the Latex plugin. That file is [here](presentation.odp)

The audio was recorded with audacity.

The final video was made using KDenLive.
